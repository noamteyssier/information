# information
ndarray-based information theory utilities.

# About
This is a crate to calculate information theory metrics with `ndarray`.
Check out the [docs](https://docs.rs/information) for usage and examples.

# Functions
This calculates `entropy`, `conditional_entropy`, `joint_entropy`, `mutual_information`, and `conditional_mutual_information`.

# Utilities
All of the above functions expect probability matrices - but this crate exposes some utility functions to build individual
and joint probability densities for multiple variables using the `prob*` and `hist*` functions.
